The new [Pustefix homepage](http://www.pustefix-framework.org) went online today. It's completely hosted on GitHub now, including issue tracking and blog.

The homepage itself is created using GitHub Pages, the old Trac issue tracker was replaced by the GitHub issue tracker, the Pustefix blog was migrated from Wordpress to GitHub Pages.
