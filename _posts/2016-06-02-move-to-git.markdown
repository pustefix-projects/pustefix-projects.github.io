Pustefix moved from svn to git. The project code now is hosted on [https://github.com/pustefix-projects/pustefix-framework](https://github.com/pustefix-projects/pustefix-framework).

The old Pustefix project hosted on sourceforge.net \([https://sourceforge.net/projects/pustefix/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pustefix/)\) has been deactivated and
the code \([https://svn.code.sf.net/p/pustefix/code](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/pustefix/code)\) will be only available indefinitely for back reference.
