        Pustefix is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1. This allows you to distribute your
        Pustefix applications as Open Source or commercial applications. Furthermore, you have full access to the
        source code which allows you to make modifications to Pustefix itself and be able to implement the features
        you desire.

      <p>
        Pustefix enforces a clean separation between your models, business logic and the presentation layout. This
        leads to a clean architecture and separation of the different application concerns. You may change the complete
        layout of the application of your applications without changing any of your Java classes.

      <div style="font-size:150%;">Recursive XSL Engine</div>
      <p>
        The view layer in Pustefix is powered by an XSL engine which applies recursive XSL transformations to your web
        sites. This allows you to build frontend components which can be modified in a central stylesheet. By applying
        more than one transformation, the layout and the structure of your components can be separated.

      <p>
        Pustefix provides an easy way to provide an application in as many languages as you need. The language can be
        set depending on server settings, browser configuration or selected by the user at runtime. Full UTF-8 support
        provides everything you need to conquer new markets.

      <p>
        The web service support in Pustefix makes your application available to different clients. Pustefix provides
        built-in support for SOAP, JSON and qooxdoo RPC. JavaScript proxy clients can be generated at build time or on
        demand at run-time. New web services can easily be plugged in thanks to the modular architecture of Pustefix.

      <p>
        Create virtual copies of your website that are served to your customers based on custom conditions. Test which
        workflow fits your users best and steadily optimise your application by analyzing user behaviour or create
        different themes for your application and let the users chose their favourite theme.

      <div style="font-size:150%;">Authentication</div>
      <p>
        Pustefix comes with a role based authentication and authorization system. Serve different content to your users
        based on their current roles and deny access to restricted content or features. You can either use the built-in
        role system or plug-in custom roles and constraints to control the access to your application.

      <div style="font-size:150%;">Modular architecture</div>
      <p>
        Create modular applications by combining your functionality in different modules that can be deployed to your
        applications. Pustefix modules feature business logic in Java and JavaScript, resources for the view layer and
        any configuration files. The build process will take care of all needed steps to install your modules and even
        execute custom post-install scripts of your modules.
